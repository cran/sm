This package uses Fortran, and you may need to supply the Makefile for
your platform. With g77 the standard install works for me, and the
supplied Makefile.sun works with gcc / f77 SC4.x on Solaris 2.x
systems here.  The problem on Solaris is __powf, and I had to link
with f77 _and_ explicitly include -lsunmath to get this included.

The Fortran code is only used in sm.density.3d and in the convex hull
routine, and Unix/Linux R uses lazy binding, so you need to run
sm.script("geys_td") to check that installation did work.
