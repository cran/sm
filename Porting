Version 1.0-2 99/04/02  Modified for 0.64, using R's chull, jitter,
			inst/* mechanism, data/00Index, file.* functions.

Version 1.0-2 99/02/20:

I altered plot.density (which causes a name clash, and is not a plot method)
to smplot.density.

All the example scripts work except those depending on gam:
	trwlgam1 trwlgam2 mackgam trwlgam3 smackgam    

As R has no chull function, I have provided one, called smchull.


R discrepancies:
===============

is.matrix is false for data frames: I used isMatrix in zzz.R instead.

Colours are (mainly) named in the R version.

In polygon() border gives the colour, not a logical for plotting.

points() does not use the current cex and pch in R.

Labels formed by deparse(substitute(x)) need to evaluated before x is altered.

persp() has fewer arguments, and the default viewpoint did not seem a
good choice for these plots, so I altered it.

glm.fit() has different arguments, and the X matrix must have column names.

jitter() is missing before R 0.63.3, and R's defaults are not helpful here.
A copy of the 0.63.3 function is in zzz.R.

is.na(x) fails in R if x is NULL.

Some functions used `break' where `return()' was meant: this does not
work in R.

The uses of unix() and assign() needed revising.

detach() named objects seemed to fail, so I used pos= instead.

There is no function acf() not acf.plot() nor tsplot() but simple
replacements sufficed.
