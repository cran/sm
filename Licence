This software is associated with the book
  
    "Applied Smoothing Techniques for Data Analysis:
    the kernel approach with S-Plus illustrations"
    by Adrian W. Bowman & Adelchi Azzalini,
    published by Oxford University Press, 1997.

It consists of two parts: the `sm library', and the `scripts'.
The sm library is a suite of S-Plus routines. The scripts form 
a layer of software above the sm library, and provide examples 
of its applications.  

The `sm` library is copyright of A.W.Bowman & A.Azzalini (1997, 
2000) except for the exceptions below.

The function sm.density calls the function sm.density.3d
to produce contour plots of three-dimensional density estimates.
This function was originally written by Stuart Young and has
been amended by Adrian Bowman.  The copyright of this function
and its subsidiary functions remains with Stuart Young.  The
copyright of the Fortran code in the file routines.f is also
held by Stuart Young.

The function sm.sphere was written jointly by Adrian Bowman
and Adrian Hines and copyright is held jointly.

The scripts are copyright of Oxford University Press (1997).

Irrespective of the individual copyrights, this software is usable 
under the `GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE', a copy of which is distributed 
together with this software.  This essentially means that this software 
can be freely used and re-distributed, but no warranty of any sort is 
provided for it.
