\title{Estimation of the error standard deviation in nonparametric regression.}
\description{This function estimates the error standard deviation in nonparametric
       regression with one or two covariates.}
\usage{sm.sigma(x, y, rawdata = NA, weights = rep(1, length(y)), 
               diff.ord = 2, ci = FALSE, model = "none", h = NA, \dots)
       }
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a vector or two-column matrix of covariate values.}
  \item{y}{a vector of responses.}
  \item{rawdata}{a list containing the output from a binning operation.
           This argument is used by \code{sm.regression} and it need not be
           set for direct calls of the function.}
  \item{weights}{a list of frequencies associated with binned data.
           This argument is used by \code{sm.regression} and it need not be
           set for direct calls of the function.}
  \item{diff.ord}{an integer value which determines first (1) or second (2)
           differencing in the estimation of sigma.}
  \item{ci}{a logical value which controls whether a confidence interval is
           produced.}
  \item{model}{a character variable.  If this is set to \code{"constant"}
           then a test of constant variance over the covariates is performed
           (only in the case of two covariates)}
  \item{h}{a vector of length two defining a smoothing parameter to be used
           in the test of constant variance.}
  \item{\dots}{other optional parameters are passed to the \code{sm.options}
           function, through a mechanism which limits their effect only to this
           call of the function; the only one relevant for this function is
           \code{nbins}.}
  }
\value{a list containing the estimate and, in the two covariate case, a 
           matrix which can be used by the function \code{sm.sigma2.compare}, 
           pseudo-residuals and, if appropriate, a confidence interval and 
           a p-value for the test of constant variance.}
