Instructions for installation (Unix)
------------------------------------

This is the S-plus library `sm', version 2 (2000), for 
nonparametric  estimation and inference using kernel smoothing 
methods, and related scripts.

Please read the file `Licence' before proceeding.

To proceed with the installation do the following:

- preferably, connect as Splus owner (typically root) and set your 
  working directory at $SHOME/library/sm;
  alternatively, connect as regular user and set your working directory
  where you keep Splus libraries, say /home/myname/spluslibraries;
- in either case do:
  	uncompress sm.tar.Z
	tar xvf sm.tar
	cd sm
- look at INSTALLx  where `x` is 3 or 5,  depending on which version of 
  Splus you have, and modify the variable Splus accordingly to your 
  system;
- in same cases you might need to
	chmod 755 INSTALLx
- finally, if you have a Fortran-77 compiler, do
	./INSTALLx
  or
	./INSTALLx no-Fortran
  if you do not have a Fortran-77 compiler; in the latter case, you loose
  the option to perform density estimation of 3-dimentional data.

If everthing goes well, the installation should now be done.

Start Splus as regular user and type
> library(sm)
for system-wide installation, or
> library(sm, lib.loc="/home/myname/spluslibraries")
for private installation
